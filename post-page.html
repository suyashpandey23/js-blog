        Having undertaken initial user research and analyzed your research
        findings, the next phase of the design process is to apply what you've
        learned by developing a series of designs to test your assumptions. In
        this article series, I'll be focusing on the initial phase of the design
        process at a higher level, from a birds eye point of view. As I explored
        in my preceding article on research, it's important to stress that we're
        building on the user research undertaken. Having analyzed our research
        findings, our goal at this phase of the design process is to: establish
        some clear user pathways that satisfy different users needs by embracing
        user stories, scenarios and storyboarding; apply some lessons from the
        world of human computer interaction (HCI) so that we design with first
        principles in mind; and establish a look and feel for our designs in a
        manner that's device-agnostic that can be applied in both a desktop and
        mobile context. In short, this article is intended to act as a bridge
        between the research phase and the design phase. As I stressed in my
        last article, the design process research, design, prototype, build,
        test is an iterative one; at this phase in the process we're focused on
        developing a series of designs that we can prototype, build and test.

        Before we get down to the details of user interface (UI) design and
        building interactive prototypes, its important to get the high-level
        flow of the design in place, establishing a skeleton around which we can
        build our design. At this point in the process its important to use our
        research findings to inform the development of user stories, identifying
        different users goals. We can use these user stories to create different
        scenarios. This helps us to identify clear goals and an underlying
        intent that guides the design process. It also enables us to develop
        flows through what we're building. When developing initial flows using
        paper prototypes and storyboards we're focused on getting a feel for the
        design in its totality, before drilling down into detail. It's important
        to get a skeleton in place and not get lost in the details, which will
        follow down the line.

        User stories are a useful way of establishing a high-level view of
        different users jobs to be done. Written from the perspective of typical
        users, they help you to establish the different goals your different
        users have so that you can design for their different needs accordingly.
        The term User Story was originated by Alistair Cockburn, one of the
        initiators of the agile movement in software development, who coined the
        phrase, “a user story is a promise for a conversation,” during a project
        for Chrysler in 1998. User stories shift the emphasis from writing about
        requirements to talking about them. Whilst subtle, this shift from
        writing to talking can have a significant impact upon the design
        process. All too often requirements are delivered in an abstract manner,
        as a list to be checked off that if you're not careful - bears little
        resemblance to what users need and more resemblance to what a design by
        committee needs. User stories help position users at the heart of the
        conversation.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        This idea, of a tool to encourage and facilitate conversation, captures
        user stories strength. They are an ideal tool to start mapping out
        scenarios, ensuring users always remain at the heart of the design and
        development process. Short descriptions of goals and features told from
        the perspective of different users, user stories help you to get an
        understanding of the underlying goals your users have so that you can
        see the problem from their perspective.
